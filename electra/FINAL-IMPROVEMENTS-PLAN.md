# Final Improvements Plan

## 1. Listing Success Animation
Add to UserMeter component:
- Full-screen success overlay
- Rocket launch animation (listing going to marketplace)
- Success message with confetti
- Auto-close after 3 seconds

## 2. Better Marketplace Card Design
Replace stacked cards with:
- **Featured Listings Carousel** at top
- **Grid with hover effects** - cards lift and expand
- **Quick stats bar** on each card
- **Animated borders** on hover
- **Better spacing** and visual hierarchy
- **Category filters** (by location, price, trust score)
- **Sort options** (price low-high, trust score, amount)

## 3. Card Design Improvements:
- Larger seller name and badge
- Price comparison (SUI vs USDC side by side)
- Trust score as progress bar
- Location with flag/icon
- Energy amount as hero element
- Hover: Card lifts, shows more details
- Click: Smooth transition to payment modal

## 4. Layout Options:
- **List View**: Table format (already have)
- **Grid View**: Enhanced cards (to improve)
- **Featured View**: Carousel of top listings
- **Compact View**: Smaller cards, more per row
